                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum
                     has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
                     took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                     only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                     unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                     Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
                    desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
                    suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
                    slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there
                    isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                    Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on
                    the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                     sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is
                     therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

                        Web pages  adapts its content to fit any device:
                        The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
                        A  viewport element gives the browser instructions on how
                        to control the page's dimensions and scaling
                        The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
                        The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</p>
